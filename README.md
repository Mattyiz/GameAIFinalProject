# GameAIFinalProject

In this project, I created an AI that would use a genetic algorithm to guess an inputed word. 
The AI generates 20 guesses where it is given the target word's length. It will then score the guesses based on how close they are to the target word. It will then cross and mutate the generations according to my algorithm.
The AI cannot operate with special characters or numbers.

In this example, the final version was able to get the "targetword" in 57 generations. This is about on par with it's average performance.
